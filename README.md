# Integrating machine learning and pathway analysis to decode biological insights from the TCGA_BRCA dataset
## Description
1. In this repository I intend to show how machine learning classification methods and pathway analysis can lead to decoding biological insights into breast cancer.
2. The TCGA_BRCA dataset can be downloaded following the R script uploaded in this repository. This dataset consists of the transcriptome profile ( Gene expression quantification ) of differnet patients with breast cancer, more details about it can be found at this link: https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects/TCGA-BRCA. The patients are classified based on two differnet types of cancer: "Primary tumor"  and "Metastastic", and normal patients: "Solid Tissue Normal"
4. Three machine learning classification methods: Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic regression, were used to predict the types of tissues among the patients. Then, pathway analysis was performed to study the biological insights of the dataset.
