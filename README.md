# Integrating machine learning and pathway analysis to decode biological insights from the TCGA_BRCA dataset
## Description
1. In this repository I intend to show how machine learning classification methods and pathway analysis can lead to decoding biological insights into breast cancer.
2. The TCGA_BRCA dataset can be downloaded following the R script uploaded in this repository.
3. The dataset consists of the transcriptome profile ( Gene expression quantification ) of differnet patients with breast cancer, more details about it can be found at this link: https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects/TCGA-BRCA
4.  
5. 


7.  All the code can be examined in the Jupyter Notebook present in the repository.
